    "•\tSchool budget is conversely related to school performance. Schools with lower average budget/spend per student performed higher. This is evident from the Average Spend based School Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCharter schools perform much higher than District schools. This is evident from the Overall Passing Percentage of Charter (~95%) Vs. District (~73%) schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDistrict school students need more help in Math. On average there is a ballpark of 30% gap in performance of District schools Vs. Charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOverall performance of schools appears to be directly related to school size, with performance significantly dropping with large school sizes in the range of 2000-5000 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAs a whole, current analysis is indicative of school performance, however, there is more analysis required across other factors, possibly education of teachers, student special needs etc. to prescribe areas of focus to improve District schools performance. \n"
